I currently work as a policy analyst at [IAC](http://idcounties.org/about/) where I conduct research and lobby on behalf of the counties' interests to the State Legislature and other State Agencies. My research efforts are most notably focused on budget and tax policy in the state of Idaho. I also staff the IAC legislative and public lands committees. To view a few of my working projects and videos click [here](/projects/).

I earned an MA at Michigan State University in the Department of Political Science. I did my undergraduate work at Boise State University where I earned a BS in political science as both a [McNair](https://mcnairscholars.com/about/), and [Top Ten](https://sps.boisestate.edu/blog/2016/04/three-political-science-majors-among-universitys-2016-top-ten-undergraduate-scholars/) Scholar. I was also a member of the [Honors College](https://honors.boisestate.edu/). Prior to my undergrad, I served five years on active duty in the United States Navy attached to the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) for four years, and one year attached to a joint service command in Ramadi and Balad, Iraq.
