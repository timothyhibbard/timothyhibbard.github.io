I currently work as a budget & policy analyst at the [Legislative Services Office (LSO)](https://legislature.idaho.gov/lso/) of the Idaho Legislature, where I serve legislators and state agencies through policy research and budget analysis. Prior to LSO I worked at the Idaho Association of counties [IAC](http://idcounties.org/about/) where I conducted data driven policy research on behalf of the counties. My research efforts most notably focuse on budget and tax policy in the state of Idaho. To view a few of my working projects and videos click [here](/projects/).

I earned an MA at Michigan State University in the Department of Political Science. I did my undergraduate work at Boise State University where I earned a BS in political science as both a [McNair](https://mcnairscholars.com/about/), and [Top Ten](https://sps.boisestate.edu/blog/2016/04/three-political-science-majors-among-universitys-2016-top-ten-undergraduate-scholars/) Scholar. I was also a member of the [Honors College](https://honors.boisestate.edu/). Prior to my undergrad, I served five years on active duty in the United States Navy attached to the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) for four years, and one year attached to a joint service command in Ramadi and Balad, Iraq.
